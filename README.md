**📊 Data Science Practice Repository**

This repository contains my data science practice work, including data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and feature engineering. 
It serves as my personal workspace for learning and applying key DS concepts using real datasets.

🚀 What’s Included:

-Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, outliers.

-Preprocessing: Encoding, scaling, transformations.

-EDA: Visualizations, distributions, correlations, insights.

-Feature Engineering: Creating new features, selection techniques.

Projects: Small case studies & experiments.

🎯 Purpose:

-Build strong foundations in data analysis

-Practice real-world workflows

-Maintain reusable scripts for future projects

-Track progress with organized examples

🛠️ Tech Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
